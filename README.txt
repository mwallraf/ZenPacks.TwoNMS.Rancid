# TODO list:
- add CVS support (currently only SVN supported)
- zenrancid status stays on "not running" in the daemons page although the daemon is started
- add zenrancid daemon statistics
- add viewVC page
- [DONE] when ZenPack installation fails then there is a problem with zProperties, they need to be commented out in the code, ZenPack uninstalled and then zProperties enabled again. Why ?
- [DONE] add zProperty for telnet/ssh access (can be controlled now manually via custom clogin in /etc folder)
- add some reports: devices under SVN control, devices missed, ...
- add some commands or Rancid menu for: starting Rancid for a single device,
  for more devices, getting config on demand, change diff
- at this moment customized router.db files can only be used for groups which already exist in Zenoss, so at least 1 device in zenoss must be enabled in the rancid group. Should be fixed
